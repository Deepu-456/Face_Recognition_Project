# Face Recognition Project

This repository contains a face recognition system that utilizes Python and advanced machine learning techniques such as HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and SVM (Support Vector Machines) for feature extraction and classification.

## Project Overview

Face recognition is a crucial field in computer vision with applications in security, surveillance, and social media. This project implements a real-time face recognition system using Python, leveraging libraries like OpenCV and dlib for robust and efficient recognition.

### Key Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition using a webcam.
- HOG + Linear SVM-based face detection for accurate and fast recognition.
- Modular code design for easy customization and extension.
